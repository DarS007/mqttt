*MQTT terminal*
MQTT is a real backbone of IoT. Lighweight, scalable, popular, etc. If you're IoT fanatic, you perhaps collected a decent set of MQTT tools in your workbench. Me too. But I was always missing a portable, small, always-on display that could connect to MQTT broker and show the circulating messages. Yeah, I know... I can fire up MQTT.fx or XXX (enter here your preference) on my desktop. But this not always is handy.
